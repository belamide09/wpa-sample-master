<h2>It's More Fun in the Philippines</h2>
      					
<p>The Philippines is an archipelagic Democratic state that is a melting pot of Eastern and Western cultures. Prior to being colonized by the Spaniards in 1565, it was already populated by a diverse society that traded with neighbouring cultures. </p>
<p>The arrival of the Spaniards, when Ferdinand Magellan landed in Samar in 1521 signalled a turning point in Philippine society. The country, named after King Felipe II, came together under a unified political and religious structure, with the introduction of Catholicism, as well as the code of law. The friars, who were the main instrument of colonisation, also established the oldest modern university in Asia, the University of Sto. Tomas, which is directly under the rule of the Vatican. </p>
<p>After the Philippine Revolution in 1898, the country gained temporary liberty, only to be colonised again by the United States of America. In 1916, the US government formally promised the country independence through the Jones Act. </p>
<p>The Philippines was then extensively damaged by the two World Wars because of American involvement in its affairs. However, it was able to recover after peace was restored across the globe. </p>	
<p>It came under dictatorship in 1972 with the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, but democracy was restored through a peaceful revolution in 1986, where President Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino.</p>
<p> Today, the country enjoys a robust economic outlook, the darling of business investors  and a vibrant society fully engaged with the global community, especially through technology. Makati, one of the major cities in the Metro, was declared the selfie capital of the world, besting even New York , in a recent poll by Time Magazine. </p>
<p>Outside the urban centres, there is a lot to appeal to the nature lover. Because it is an archipelago, the Philippines is home to numerous magnificent beaches. Trekkers who love mountaineering can also find a mountain or two to climb here. </p>

<h2>Language</h2>
<p>Filipino, which is a variation of the Tagalog dialect, is the National Language. English is widely spoken. Waylay an ordinary pedestrian and you can hold a decent conversation with him, albeit sometimes you must expect  broken English, which the locals facetiously call Carabao English (after the National Animal, the Carabao, or the water buffalo). </p>

<h2>Dining and Shopping</h2>
<p>There are notable destinations near the Philippine International Convention Centre for dining, most of them posh hotels, among them the historic Manila Hotel, Bayleaf Hotel, Hotel Sofitel, and Manila Diamond Hotel. For your shopping fix, the nearest destination is the SM Mall of Asia, which is situated conveniently near Roxas Boulevard and is large enough to cater to most of your cravings. But if you have a day to spare, head on out to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig  City and Ayala Centre in Makati City (which are situated beside each other) for a truly cosmopolitan experience.  They have luxury shops, five star hotels, as well as museums and outdoor cafes that will give you a feel of what a day out feels like for the locals.  </p>


<h2>Historical Sites</h2>
<p>The Convention Venue is near relics of Spanish rule such as the walled city of Intramuros, and within it, the Fort Santiago, where the National Hero Gat. Jose P.Rizal was incarcerated prior to his execution at the nearby Luneta Park. Inside the walled city are two beautiful Churches, the Manila Cathedral and the San Agustin Church, which are both rich repositories of Spanish colonial history. </p>

<h2>Credit Cards</h2>
<p>Most shops accept credit cards, but bazaars and public markets don't so it's best to carry cash with you. Carry them in small denominations (hundreds and below, no five hundred and one thousand notes) and in separate wads that you can keep in  different pouches in your bag. When going for a stroll, err on the side of caution and don't bring important documents and IDs with you. Just the cash you'll need for the trip and one credit card and ID will do. </p>
